  # THIS IS THE BUG: Having a triggers section with ONLY exclude
  # causes newGlobalTriggersAcceptAll to be TRUE
  triggers:
    exclude:
      branch:
        - r/some-excluded-branch/
    # This explicitly says: only run on label_added
    on:
      - commit

    should_only_run_on_label:

              ðŸ”´ BUG REPRODUCED: This should ONLY run on label_added, but it triggered on a different event!
